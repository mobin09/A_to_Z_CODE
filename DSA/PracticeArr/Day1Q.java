/*
 * Minimum house number
PrepBuddy lives in a colony, where N houses are built in a single row numbered from 0 to N âˆ’1
.The first house has a house number 0, the second house has a house number 1
 and so on, every house pays some rent at the end of the month.
Help PrepBuddy in finding out the house number of the house paying the minimum rent.

Note: All house rents are unique.

Input format
First line contains test case T.
T test cases follow,
First line contains N representing the number of houses.
Second line contains the rent of the N houses.

Output format
For each test case on a new line, print house numbers(0- based indexing) that satisfy the above-mentioned condition.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 5
2 <= N <= 100

1 <= A[i]<=
1000
